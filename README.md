## What is Tiny Tapeout?

Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital and analog designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Set up your Verilog project

1. Add your Verilog files to the `src` folder.
2. Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and update information about your project, paying special attention to the `source_files` and `top_module` properties. If you are upgrading an existing Tiny Tapeout project, check out our [online info.yaml migration tool](https://tinytapeout.github.io/tt-yaml-upgrade-tool/).
3. Edit [docs/info.md](docs/info.md) and add a description of your project.
4. Adapt the testbench to your design. See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for more information.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/).

### Quick Start Journal (for agneya)
- remember to `wsl --shutdown`
- to generate a .vcd, instantiate the virtual python environment `source venv/bin/activate` IN WSL and run `make -B` in the test folder

- if starting a new project, open WSL, run `python -m venv venv` in the test folder. Then, `source venv/bin/activate` to start the virtual environment. Then, `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages.

- start wsl
- python3 -m venv venv (create virtual environment. MUST BE MADE IN WSL)
- source venv/bin/activate (activate virtual environment)
- pip install -r requirements.txt (install necessary packages)
- change the module name in tb.v
- make -B (run the testbench)

## Doesn't this just look amazing?
